# Network-Data-Visualiser-using-D3.js
This application makes use of web server to serve the static data file that contains multiple datasets as json data objects. These json objects are used to visualise as a network of nodes and relationships. The nodes are sites and the relationship are the weights of trade between each of the sites. The size of the nodes are proportional to the trade amount and the width of the amount of trade. The visualisation is created purely using D3.js
